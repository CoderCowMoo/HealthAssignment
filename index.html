            </div>
            <p class = "maintext">Stigma is an entirely negative behaviour of cultures past, meant to reserve strength. It has been discovered that mental health and the discussion of it
                                  is helpful in dealing with illnesses such as depression and anxiety. Stigma is harmful for those suffering from it and community as a whole. The victim of stigma
                                  often feels shameful and isolated from the community around them. They feel self-doubt and a lack of self-confidence. This leads to less opportunities for employment or
                                  social interaction. Unfortunately this can sometimes lead to suicide from the helplessness. As it can be seen, stigma merely makes the problem worse and no solutions
                                  can arrise from pressure.</p>

            If you are reading this and suffering from stigma, here are a few techniques or strategies you may employ to help cope.
            <br>
            <br>
            Firstly, remind yourself that you are above your illness and it is merely another roadblock to surpass.
            <br>
            <br>
            Secondly, most discrimination comes from those who haven't suffered from mental illness or are pushing off their problems onto you. You must not take insults personally as
            that is harmful to your health.
            <br>
            <br>
            Mental illness is not a sign of weakness and in fact, having the courage to talk about it shows that you are adamant on self-improvement.
